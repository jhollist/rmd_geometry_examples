# Examples: RMarkdown with the LaTeX geometry package

Some examples on how to use the geomerty package via YAML specifications in RMarkdown.  These are just a few, for more see <https://ctan.org/pkg/geometry>  I haven't tested anything but I would expect anything you can specify as options for the geometry pacakge should work.
